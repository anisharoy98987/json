This cool air results from partial evaporation of raindrops, which absorbs heat and lowers the temperature of the surrounding air. The cooled air becomes denser and sinks, spreading outward as a ‘cold bubble’. Cold pools are important in meteorology because they affect the stability of the atmosphere and the development of new storms."

        "explanation": "The UAE is strategically located near the Strait of Hormuz, one of the world's most important oil transit chokepoints. Around one-third of global seaborne oil passes through this narrow strait between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. This makes the UAE (especially emirates like Abu Dhabi and Dubai) crucial for international energy security. In addition, its proximity to key maritime routes enhances its influence in global shipping, trade, and defence strategies. Its desert geography and tropical climate are also notable features."
