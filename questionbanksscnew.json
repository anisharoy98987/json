        "explanation": "NGOs and civil society organisations (CSOs) are crucial in bridging the 'last-mile gap' in India’s digital landscape. While the government sets national policy, these groups work at the community level to raise awareness about cyber hygiene—like avoiding phishing links, using strong passwords, recognizing fake apps, etc. In villages and underserved areas connected via BharatNet or using digital banking, these users are highly vulnerable to cyber fraud. The Ministry of Electronics and IT's 'Information Security Education and Awareness (ISEA)' program and the 'Cyber Surakshit Bharat' campaign actively collaborate with such groups to spread digital literacy. For instance, in 2023, campaigns with NGOs helped train rural women in Rajasthan and Jharkhand on secure smartphone usage. This bottom-up approach strengthens national cyber resilience by turning individuals into the first line of defense."

        "options": [
          "Because it works faster than classical computers",
          "Because it uses random number generation for brute-force attacks",
          "Because it can factor large prime numbers exponentially faster, breaking RSA and ECC encryption",
          "Because it manipulates encrypted data using artificial intelligence"
        ],
        "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
        "explanation": "Quantum computers leverage quantum mechanics to perform certain operations exponentially faster than classical computers. One of the most famous quantum algorithms—Shor’s Algorithm—can factor large prime numbers efficiently, breaking the backbone of RSA encryption. Similarly, Grover’s Algorithm can reduce brute-force search time. As a result, widely used public-key cryptographic systems (like those used in digital signatures, secure browsing, and ATM transactions) become insecure. Governments worldwide, including India, are now investing heavily in quantum-safe cryptography. The Indian Army and DRDO are already testing secure quantum communication between defense centers. If India doesn’t act promptly, critical systems like Aadhaar, health records, and digital banking could be exposed to quantum threats in the near future."

        ],
        "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "Stablecoins are considered more reliable than volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin because they are usually pegged to real-world assets such as the U.S. dollar or gold. This linkage keeps their value relatively constant, making them ideal for transactions, remittances, and as a digital store of value. For example, USDT (Tether) and USDC (USD Coin) are widely used stablecoins. Unlike Bitcoin, which can fluctuate by hundreds of dollars in a single day, stablecoins maintain parity with their pegged value. This has made them attractive for use in cross-border payments, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), and e-commerce, especially in economies with unstable local currencies."

This dual influence makes Iceland prone to volcanic activity and frequent earthquake swarms—sequences of many small earthquakes without a major main shock. These swarms can precede volcanic eruptions, such as the recent lava eruption from a massive fissure triggered by a swarm of quakes in 2025."

      "options": [
        "They continuously release heat until they fade",
        "They change direction depending on solar winds",
        "They initially release heat but later absorb and retain it",
        "They become harmless before reaching Earth"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are massive bursts of solar plasma and magnetic fields ejected from the Sun’s outer atmosphere, or corona. Astronomers recently discovered that CMEs exhibit a unique thermal behavior—initially, they release heat, but midway through their journey toward Earth, they begin to absorb and retain heat. This finding came after a powerful CME caused rare northern lights (auroras) in Ladakh in May 2024. Fast CMEs can reach Earth in 15–18 hours and cause geomagnetic storms that disrupt satellites, communication networks, and power grids. Studying this behavior is important for predicting space weather and protecting infrastructure."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "In a significant judgment (Estate Officer, HUDA vs. landowners), the Supreme Court of India clarified that rehabilitation is not a fundamental right. Although Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees the right to life, the Court ruled that the loss of livelihood due to land acquisition does not automatically entitle affected persons to rehabilitation. Fair monetary compensation is constitutionally mandated, but offering alternative housing or employment lies outside the Court's jurisdiction unless explicitly provided by law. The Court reaffirmed earlier judgments like Amarjit Singh vs. State of Punjab (2010) and State of MP vs. Narmada Bachao Andolan (2011), which also emphasized this limitation."

        "explanation": "The Pacific Ring of Fire is a horseshoe-shaped zone around the Pacific Ocean known for its frequent earthquakes and active volcanoes. This area is seismically active due to the continuous movement of tectonic plates—massive slabs of the Earth's crust that shift and interact. These interactions cause earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of deep trenches like the Mariana Trench, the world’s deepest spot. Roughly 90% of the world’s earthquakes and 75% of all active volcanoes are located along this ring, including regions like Alaska, Japan, and Chile."

        "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
        "explanation": "The WTO’s Dispute Settlement Mechanism has been in crisis since 2016 due to the United States repeatedly blocking the appointment of new judges to the WTO Appellate Body. This has prevented the panel from functioning due to a lack of quorum, effectively paralyzing the global dispute resolution system. This move by the US stems from concerns about bias and judicial overreach. As a result, trade disputes between nations are left unresolved or delayed, weakening the credibility and enforcement power of the WTO."

These include digital platforms like social media and crowdfunding websites, virtual assets such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and even online gaming platforms that allow peer-to-peer money transfers. However, 'barter trade of essential commodities' is not identified as an emerging method in the report. Hence, this is the correct answer."

      "explanation": "Terrorist Financing (TF) refers to the process of providing funds for terrorist activities. The FATF report points out that one of the key enablers of terrorist financing in regions such as Africa and South Asia is the presence of porous borders. These are loosely regulated or unmonitored border regions through which terrorists and their financiers can smuggle money, weapons, and people without detection. This makes it easier for small cells or lone actors to operate with minimal financial oversight. Other contributing factors include weak law enforcement and political instability."

      "explanation": "Terrorist organizations such as Boko Haram often rely on illegal and criminal means to generate income. One such method is the illicit trade in natural resources like gold, timber, and oil. These commodities are often stolen or mined illegally in conflict regions and then sold on black markets. In addition to resource smuggling, groups may also engage in extortion, kidnapping for ransom (KFR), and drug trafficking. These activities help fund their operations, purchase arms, and maintain control over local populations. The use of online gaming or legal exports is not a major strategy for these groups."

        "explanation": "Mud volcanoes differ significantly from traditional igneous volcanoes. Instead of emitting molten lava and ash, they erupt with a slurry of mud, water, and gases—primarily methane. These eruptions are driven by subterranean pressure from tectonic activity or the compaction of sediments, rather than from molten magma. As such, mud volcanoes pose a different set of environmental and geological risks compared to conventional volcanoes."

        "explanation": "According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) 2025 report, global public debt reached an estimated $102 trillion in 2024. This surge in debt is attributed to factors such as high interest rates, pandemic-related spending, climate finance needs, and global inflation pressures. UNCTAD warns that rising debt is particularly burdensome for developing economies, many of which face increasing debt-servicing costs that divert funds from essential services like health, education, and climate adaptation."

This reflects the rapid economic expansion, infrastructure investments, and borrowing needs of large economies like India, China, and Indonesia. While this region also contributes significantly to global GDP, the rising debt levels underscore the importance of sustainable fiscal planning and international support mechanisms, especially in a post-pandemic economic recovery phase."
